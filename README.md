# Self Paced Reading Data Parser
Tool for examining data dumps from self paced reading expiriments, basically a CSV parser with a special application.

Example data can be found in `225_Project3_Experiment_Results.csv`

### Note About Acedemic Integrity
Yes I used this code to help me with that specific project however this code was never submitted as it was not part of the assignment.
The data uploaded for the example format was generated from students in my particular class, including myself, a while ago and should therefore not provide any answers explicitly to any future students in the somewhat unlikely case this specific project is still being assigned.
